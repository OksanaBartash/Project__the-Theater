#5 Project_the-Theater

This is a website that offers services to children, and their parents will discover their creative potential. 
I collaborated with my groupmates, and we always supported each other, ensuring smooth operation.

My contributions to this site include:

   * "Main" Block: This block was made with Flexbox.
     I used the CSS component "order" and changed the order of elements in this block for different screens.
     Also, I made a button that downloads a PDF document from the site when the user clicks on it (schedule).

   * Window-Form "SignUp": with input fields for name and phone, and buttons "Close" and "Send form".
     Form work with JavaScript for field validations (correct information) and sending to the server.
     When the user inputs correct information, they can see the second window with successful registration.

   * "Main actors" Block: with reviews from clients and their photos.
     I made this block with Swiper, which has a "coverflow" effect.

   * Made the entire site with Perfect Pixel standards.

During my work on this project, I used HTML, CSS for typesetting (extensively employing Flexbox), JavaScript (for working with Swiper and Form-windows), Git repository, and PerfectPixel. 
I also utilized Figma for the layout and Trello as a task board. 
I implemented Bootstrap and Swiper@11 libraries, converted, and compressed all images for optimal website performance.

The layout of the blocks is adaptive, ranging from the mobile version to the desktop version, ensuring correct display on tablets and other devices with adaptive adjustments for images, buttons, and text.
